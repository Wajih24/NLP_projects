What do you mean by the word sniped?
I love this video!! I‚Äôm bisexual and it‚Äôs just really nice to hear that someone has gone through similar things like me and that I‚Äôm not alone. My story is nothing like his and my heart goes out to him to slowly heal from that

A PERSON'S CHARACTER MATTERS. PERIOD!!
@Blaster of Gasters
i bet if they bood when he said black lives matter then everyone in the crowd wouldve been 100% racist
when are we gonna get over this beef and deal with China's expanding military presence?
Why u r looting and hurting other people property in the name of block life matter..
All lives matter not just black people that's bull crap we r all the same all family matter
We can come first then all can come after

some people don‚Äôt like it as they take it as a campaign to their campaign and some people don‚Äôt get attacked by police as much as blacks or feel as much prejudice
Please and thanks xD
BLM isn't about black lives.nIt's the blacker version of ANTIFA.  George Sorros.
Everyone matters stop racism
You had me on Microaggressions nBye Bye
Kielbasa Boy Why? They aren‚Äôt doing anything wrong
@Jeff Davis I agree with you that every life should matter equally. But the fact is Black Lives ARE being mistreated particularly by the police force. Have you not seen George Floyd being killed without resisting arrest? Whilst a white serial killer who shot multiple black lives was calmly arrested? Nobody is saying JUST black lives matter. Those who do say it do not understand and belong to the BLM movement.
This is the reason I will always stan for Madonna.
And start teaching unrevised US history and the constitution.
The more black lives matter are around the more they proved that black lives don't not matter
@Zach Jerde bro theyre a child. Grow up
All lives matter.  There

this is so sad i
@Nighthawk-Walz yeah I can understand that. If that's what you gotta do then do you. Decentralized movements will always have their fair share of radicals. It's not like the government where everything has established rules or regulations. The facts are always up for interpretation too. There's no way to really know the intentions behind the killings. The fact of the matter is that someone was unjustly killed and people continue to be unjustly killed. Another fact is that there are large disparities between races in crime. Another fact is that unarmed black people are still twice as likely to be killed. And yet another fact is that alot the names that I mentioned had preventable deaths.ü§∑‚Äç It's hard to decipher much from that information. My perspective on these issues is in part shaped by my understanding of race issues within the US. If you take a more skeptical approach to things
BLM actually has good policy positions. It's just that people associated with the movement that ruin it.
This country belongs to whichever group of people is strong enough to possess it. If I come and take you apple from your lunch tray and we fight over it and you're not strong enough to take it back and then I eat it then it became my apple by the law of survival of the fittest. If this country was still the natives or if it was black peoples or the Spanish then they would be the controlling power but none of them are so therefore it is our country until anybody else is strong enough to take it from us. Every group of people that occupy a region on this earth are not the original inhabitants of that region

@Chinskins Tron no sense at all. Where does it say he hates people that uses his name in vain so so tapped because you litteraly say he hates everyone because we all sin so please do better research and actually read the Bible not some stupid Wikipedia page
palmtain I mean they don‚Äôt have to agree with homosexuality.
@TEAM XBOX It doesn't say that anywhere in the Bible.  Prove it.

It will only get worst from here... so we will make sense and look smart to them
Waun is good for fox news
guuudyyy black lives matter isn‚Äôt about that only black lives matter. It‚Äôs about that black lives should also matter. You feel threatened so you‚Äôre missing the point.
jo ma then you‚Äôd gone to the wrong church. Pls try a Spirit-filled
You put the word ONLY there. BLM does not mean white lives don't.. This is what Fox News is trying to frame it. BLM means black lives matters Too.

Bea Millan-Windorski combat roles? It's because the average women is much less capable of serving in stressful combat situations than a man.Still to this day only 5% of the military are women. Does this surprise you? Also you need a lot of strength when serving. You think any women can drag a wounded soldier to safety. The female req for serving is 19 pushups but for males it's 37 pushups. Does this seem fair? Also women are higher maintenance than men so when every penny counts
Why us it ok to vote for Obama purely because he is black is totally fine

Humanity is doomed. We were doomed from the very beginning lmao. Our failure is inevitable
@everett Thomas They can but the police don't want Riots to get too violent. They already tried to attack a man who pulled down signs in the defaced Churchill statue.
Police were probably too busy bending a knee or painting rainbow flags on their cars.
The reason = politically correct = votes
Where did you decide to get that haircut

@Mikey Inman so sad right. The rabit whole is so deep but people just get mad n dont even look up anything. Its just brainwashing. It breaks my heart because all this stuff the musicians do is all to hurt  others because they are loyal to the elites. But they are fully mk-ultra and totured themselves. Noone should go through that. Its horrible torture that u can barely break out of. Except for a few like britney spears kanye west ect. But they either get sacrificed or programed right back to make money from. The fbi even admits to the monarch programing mk ultra. They torture children and adults. I would never want to b in hollywood at all. People regrey so much after they sign that blood contract but they only basically get out through death cuz theyre too much of a risk to tell the truth. Many are telling the sick truth but even then they often r brushef off. Just research its right there.

b888  All lives matter is not the same as black lives matter. There is no all lives matter movement. It‚Äôs only brought up to speak over people of color asking for needed change. All lives matter is obvious and is implied in BLM
just because she has short hair?
You are Jewish.... Study an hour more and you'll be winning the Nobel

@Savannah Gardner But the thing is

This is the real Madonna... I'm so happy to see interviews like these you can clearly see how intelligent she is
It‚Äôs single motherhood.  Notice the whites supporting BLM are super liberal which is extremely common among single mother households but pretty rare among two parent households.  Liberalism itself isn‚Äôt

Ironic Madonna is superfical
@ImAlfie Even if its a ploy you really don't need to be talking about her sexuality because it doesn't matter to you and you got yourself involved by talking about it. Nobody forced you to talk about it.nnnThis discussion is over.

@ur mom is a cat who experience more travesty and violation of said nature isn't important. nthe fact that it is happening and should be stopped is.nthe mere fact that you segregate it by race to further some kind of agenda or push your opinion on others is pretty racist

Those monuments are of people who forcefully took black people from Africa and enslaved them. They killed
This video makes me want to get into law enforcement so I can work with this great Sheriff!
I would never give support to a group that assaults police officers. Shaming white americans to give their support. This is a hate group disguised as a civil rights movement.
Between 1750 and 1820 about 1.5 million Europeans and Americans were kidnapped and forced into slavery by the Barbary states of North Africa.nnHow should reparations be calculated for the descendents of those people?nnFix the problems of today
@Jason Aguirre¬†it says the way you judge others is the way God will judge you. if you judge others justly and righteously then you will be judge justly and righteously.
Like the cops that killed him weren‚Äôt themselves. Also it‚Äôs criminals
Black racists should be put on trial. This racisme has to be stopped.
Discussion under censorship is pointless
This is hard to watch
This black panel says it all! Dems bait & click performance
Feminism focuses on first world problems
it is a hate group that is much like the KKK
being anti theistic doesn't mean religious people don't enjoy your opinion
We‚Äôll walk in together. I‚Äôll be the devil on your shoulder drag queens
In other words democrats are making it controversial because they know no other party politicians are prepared to make such overtly racist statements
I say EVERY life matters!!
All fucking lives matter.To say otherwise is racist.Human life is special and skin colour is irrlevant.To use the death of a man to promote racial divison is pathetic and damaging.R.I.P. George Floyd.

nope. this is officially the largest civil rights movement in history. the last one in the 60s lasted several years and we still have more work to do. No Justice

@kragger1985 You're another person who just doesn't get it. There are more White people in America. The numbers are going to be higher. The chances of an unarmed Black man being killed by a police officer is alarming.

Realize Black lives matter is designed to cause division.  All lives matter is to state unity.  We are in this together. The tactic of divide and conquer is ancient...  But still works!
There's an old proverb that says the left-wing and the right-wing belong to the same bird. I think to say one view is inherently left and one is inherently right is limiting the expansion of knowledge by having It's us versus them mentality.
Black lives matter was a group formed in response to black people getting shot by police officers more than any other race. that's what they mean by it. conservatives are intentionally misinterpreting it because they're dumb.
This is what I call black supremacy.
@Vernice Davis That makes no sense whatsoever

it would be nice if She and Cyndi Lauper finally did something together... song or tv appearance ... it's odd that they have been at the same place / same time ... but never photographed together.

What this video shows is that systemic racism does not exist.  Fact.  It only exists as an excuse for failure.

Kao Saechao ok but do you know who funded blm because it‚Äôs not a black person
No because white privilege.
I mean if she did actually say she was LGBT then okay that's what she did
@Cannonball So you want racial equality but saying that black lives matter more? Where is the logic? BLM is just feminism for black people.

It is controversial because it is a disingenuous debate tactic to distract from the issue. I think everyone understands that Black Lives matter meansNon_hope_speech
It's like feminism. They want equal gender rights but they really want to be supremacists
When you move out of your parent's basement you'll learn how bad people really are in reality vs the media. Gonna vote Hillary huh? I wonder how many more people she'll let die through war profiting or just abandon like Benghazi. All while she laughs.

Crystal is literally going to be president someday
Slavery is still alive today
All lives matter. We just need to allow time for minority races to catch up.
+bloodsoldierZ because all lives matter plays on the racial discrimination that has been plaguing our civilization for centuries. and as far as the veterans go that's not a racial problem veterans are all colors not just one. black lives matter came out of a violent racial  episode that should not have happened. and it is ignorance that keeps it going.
@Simon Sloototter how do they initiate and cultivate racism in society
@it'sMe TheHerpes No we need more of him across the world
You're being played by a globalist network manipulating you under black lives matter. You're on the plantationn

I feel bad for them I mean can you image the fact that people would dare to say what job you have! Then ask what type of engineer you are! I mean face it you show charts of 12% of engineers are women and take the fact that they are spread out in us I mean you would not see much around. Calling it rampant is my favorite part. looks like another case of triggered. nnalso on the side note. My feminist spidey senses sense bullshit. Like as if they made some of it up? Wired go cry to buzz feed

@Molly Rebekah I'm bi and its people like you who made me scared to tell people out of fear of being attacked by people. 18 fucking years I hid because of that. When I finally thought I could say it I would see comments like these and break down thinking no one would ever except me. I went through anxiety and depression and all because I couldn't be who I wanted to be... Do you know how hard that is... So go ahead and pray for me because I would rather go to hell than ever meet someone like you who makes people feel bad about who they are.
@Dave Raymond Wait
I'm sorry that you had to go thru all that abuse. The world is full of bad people
They need to change it Poor Lives Matter...that‚Äôs really what it comes down to. You broke? You‚Äôll lose. Period.
Um doesn't the word ALL include everyone? Doesn't Black only include one? All Lives Matter!!
Black Lives Matter..Bad name. Change it to Life Matters.  Don't be guilty of selective compassion. LIFE MATTERS! Even animal lives. Don't be a hypocrite.
beautiful and inspiring from a lovely strong woman..i wanna be a food engineer too..ladies go for your dreams

What about their rioting and looting after the protest?
Who was president during the 68 riots?
This is gross. Im unsubscribing.
But they had lynchings when there was a strong nuclear black family
@star dust It's less about George Floyd and more around the circumstances of his death. As for him being a criminal while he did commit a crime he did do his time and turned his life around.
This is really my favourite singer. She's still very strong even with all the bad things she had to fight against.
If saying all lives matter is bad but BLM is good we can welcome a new type of radical movement the black racial communism

Molly Cone Cuz I @d another person and used generalizations. Also the kool aid thing is an expression not an accusation. I was more dissing the fact that you‚Äôd do anything as long as it was in the Bible. Man if I could go back in time and add a line saying to jump off a cliff to get into heaven
These types of Christians make us look so bad
That would uh be just uh pure meannnSHE SAID WHAT SHE SAID.
Improving ALL cops training and evaluation of their job and who(non mental low intelligence cops) they hire should matter would solve most these issues.  Increase in pay might get better candidates for position as well.
BLM - Burn Loot March
Because he is telling the truth that homosexuality is wrong?
@Brodie Stark so you're ignorant and stupid. Lol. Funny how it works. It's all a reflection.

@Alexhs Savvakhs because it based on black victimhood mentality toward what white people did in the past that make them as slave. It is about white-black people. It is the fact that there is term white guilt that they are using right now.nnWe can stop racism by stop using color language. If one of us are being discriminated
JAMES WHITELEY they have for years but the council have been doing nothing about.

Who invented the rules on saying what colour should be in front of lives  matter
The fact a lot of people become famous and forget who helped them become famous and Madonna did not! She basically saying the lgbtq helped me become me and in return I‚Äôm forever in there ‚Äúdebt.‚Äù (In a good way) and I will never forget that and will All ways help out. It‚Äôs not just saying okay I support the lgbtq it‚Äôs acutely doing something on a daily and not just during pride and Madonna shows that and she helped us as we helped her and that‚Äôs amazing!!!
So you just proved how judgemental you are
It sure does.  I think it's time to vote straight Democrat and wipe out the Racist party.

Black lives matter is not saying that all lives don't matter. Of course all lives matter. Also all lives matter is a dumb combatant to black lives matter. Black lives matter is simply stating that we're a part of this society too and we would like to be treated in such a way.Basically stop pissing on us. So there's really no need to challenge it.

Comparing the Berlin wall to a trashy old statue no one had an issue with until a few days ago is utterly stupid.

BLM is a racist platform that supports free handouts because of the suffering from slavery
LIE. BIG LIE. There is no way a professor from a respected university would humiliate a student in front of the class no matter how bad their work is. At least the professor would never call names.
It's not that most women can't do engineering. They certainly can and they do it better than most men because they're more responsible and hard-working. It's that most women are not interested.

@mya kahlo lol nice rant. BLM has done a lot on social media so the hashtag DOES make a difference. Why do you think it made the news? Why do you think we're talking about it? Quote me on where exactly I said your opinions are unwelcome. I pretty much agree with everything you say
Firelife0510 xX yeah the slogan should be human lives matter

Strawman argument wont work on people with a brain. No one is saying white lives dont matter. People are saying black lives matter
I love that this brought together so many female engineers. At my school

The fact that some people In the comments actually believe that people who are part of the LGBTQ choose to be apart of it is ridiculous. Like yeah guys I chose to be hated and bullied etc.. Cause tht makes total sense
Says this conversation was posted 4 years ago and we're still trying to come to a conclusion on that one subject SMH ü§¶
If the fact that this was 4 years ago (around election) and now we are having the same discussions. It shows that this is purely political as Dems just want votes.
@Khadra A so you're offended by the statement all lives matter?  That says a lot about you.
Bunch of lunatics
If life was fair she would be president not Trump. Double standards are exhausting. She however has some talent too.

@amanda grothmann nFirst things first . Black Lives Matter needs to be abolished and replaced with a group that truly cares about the black inner cities . 80% of the BLM funding goes to the Democratic Party !  Simply horrible !  It proves that it is more about politics then it is about helping black people . Saying All Lives Matter is our god given right

Oh that made me so mad.
What passes for meaning at this time is too pathetic to document as history.
@QueenOfIndians totally disagree. Most of her publicity came from bad press. Good press is great
What‚Äôs are you protesting?Democrats are corrupt and have exploited black People and their life‚Äôs in general are worse off now than prior to the civil rights movement because of the way democrats brainwashed them with false propaganda and lies.They want power and pay and they sick them in white men making them think they are victims that need them to defend them do they can keep their mansions and prestige.Drmocrsts are evil and exploit black People and brainwash others into believing their lies are true .They are systemic racist  against white makes and even try and convince others thru their brainwashing tactics that they should be.Very evil bunch.

@BJGvideos You know Oliver is right
Okay. I'm gonna share my honest opinion. I don't think these protests are so much anti-racist
These kids are so smart.
This is such a beautiful story. I was almost in tears. I'm pursuing a career in engineering as well and even as a guy i don't know if engineering is welcoming for everyone. However it is true that the presence of women is quite shocking.
This shreriff is clown all life matters

@Kurt Sno idiots supporting idiots. Half dont have a clue. Trust me.
Somehow I doubt religious people would think divine power stops working just cause you don't believe. That would kinda undermine their faith. So obviously they'd trust in the power of those words regardless of your own belief.

How about an interview with someone who God changed? The other side of the spectrum where a spiritual and supernatural change actually happened? I know many who will astound you with their stories. Will you interview them? Will you let your kids marvel and question them?
That abortion video was disgusting.
The goal is to end racism
Christ.. ...cry about something which matters.
@Maricopa_Today you are the best type of religious person
All of you naysayers are the fools that are brainwashed to not look at people like Madonna as good or inspirational. She helped a lot of people in the community she‚Äôs discussing. You see good PR and satanism. You‚Äôre the brain dead and brainwashed ones and have a bleak outlook.

Hey.  Do you need a lot of maths for that?
White lives already matter
@Aaliyah Yusuf here in PL white police kill mostly white ppl
No lives matter. Also George Floyd was a piece of s*** Criminal
All they are pushing is a racist movement. Their violence must not be tolerated. Their forcefulness will have to be met with another force. That  is the thing thing the understand. Peaceful BLM ? Look what they have done in London. Their followers are brainwashed emotional infants. They just can't think. The just react emotionally.
All lives matter but black lives matter is just meant to show that black lives matter to people who don‚Äôt know. It‚Äôs not saying black lives matter most.

I'm in total agreement with your post!

Just a questions. What if those white slave traders didn‚Äôt bring black people in the western world. Do you think they will have the chance to fight for their right while still in African countries? Will they insist for rights if stuck in country where they all have the same African rights without seeing or knowing the prosperity of the western world?

the racists can say anything they want and the government supports them.
@Chris for now!  Until they change those to fit their political agenda!  Black people were naked when we found them....so what?

that's exactly the point! the word racism doesn't mean hate against black people. it means shaming someone for their ethnicity. we shouldn't be saying that the anti-white movement is reverse racism because it's just flat-out racism.
@Kevin Burrow Pretty much everybody who as a statue standing somewhere as owned slaves at one point or another

@Vernice Davis I'm not trying to be hatefull. I know that BLM wasnt made to be racist it was to say black lives matter too and to fix their issues but now in the modern world BLM has just become a white hating group and it's ridiculous that people are trying to justify killing white people because the're white.
Only racists will be upset by this

Alright . I actually tried to watch the video untill the end and this is what I have to say. Most of their points are basically sassy complaints that cant be helpt for women (for now). They are not a majority

@darkmantlestudios Yeah but now BLM can claim that they are not honoring the agreement.
I think all lives matter. I mean come on only black lives matter? Why only them i mean sure they have to deal with a lot of crap but who doesn't? It's just that many people around the world no matter the race or skin color are probably dealing with the same stuff. I think that it is not fair to say only one race lives matter when in fact all of them do.

Great idea! Send them back to the motherland. I‚Äôm sure they will thrive there without whites!
@Head Elf Then you're looking in the wrong place. Nobody should be attacked for their beliefs
@Duribethin Um idk where you got the idea that it's a 'self declared marxist movement' like you can't just use that term to describe anything that is on the left of you. Also black lives matter as a movement is concerned with more than just black people who were physically or mentally harmed because of white people as you implied. It's also focused on the systemic injustices that keep a lot of black people at the bottom of the food chain such as underfunding in predominantly black areas. Blm does care about all black people and people who died because of black on black crime are included. It's just that they aren't killed or harmed because of racism or prejudice.

Idiots the statue was there presently as a reminder of the horror of the slave trade and how we should never forget. the original purpose of the statue which was built over 100 years ago was to celebrate it. but this piece of historical remembrance now lies at the bottom of the bristol harbour. we should not celebrate the slave trade but remember it and instead of drowning our past we should learn from not censor it but explain the cold hard truths of our past and if people are going to complain about slavery complain about the suffering of millions in Africa's cocoa farms south America's coffee workers and the horrific treatment of those in the middle east. #blacklivesmatter

@Tracey Henderson Different standard for women in  the industry.  It's a double standard.
@softbubble cuz you never hear about it. When a cop kills a black person everybody thinks it's racist but when a cop kills a white person nobody goes protesting.
Look up ‚Äúwhy it is hurtful to say All lives matter?‚Äù Then you will see
What do Bristol City Council have to say for themselves now?

God loves the sinner
They boo for the life of other's  for been a different color.nThat's racist.
Exactly. I‚Äôm in it right now and it‚Äôs terrible. I can‚Äôt even begin to talk about how disgusting it is.
This a lot of protesting for one guy George Floyd just happened to be black
It will still be worthless.
I'm Catholic too god bless you!
ITS A GOOD JOB WE ARE NOT DESTROYING MONUMENTS IN AFRICA..........THERE ARE NONE!!!!!!!!!!!
All I have to say
Stephanie Smith Not just STEM but anything.
It's their religion. Pay attention next time.
I made it through 90 secs of thieir microaggressions before I was triggered.  Where can I find safe space?
Conversion therapy is not ever successful. That person isn‚Äôt ‚ÄúdEliVerED‚Äù or whatever. All of the techniques he mentioned here are the same used for mind controlü§î.
@LG yes. She is a broken-winged bird
Wait that was a girl?
Moth Kid all scripture is the inherent word of God
@Amaia Marshall dude look at the name
His questions are specifically for her
He was a philanthropist

No kids don't need this and this comment section has been culled of free speech.
The young lady with short hair could be in the closet OR she could be recovering from a medical condition and regrowing her hair. She also could have donated her hair or this is just her chosen style.
I wonder if Banksy will be giving us his take on any of these scenes?!  That would be interesting ü§î
Every life matters it's pretty simple. God loves you all.  Learn to love one another
fluff ball bruh then what are you?? Straight is heterosexual. That‚Äôs a sexuality.
@Petya D. Why not I'm in africa will be interesting to watch tho.
New born babies that are killed through planned Parenthood called abortion matter
Well done. Move that statue to somewhere
Exactly. Why is it so controversial to say all lives matter? Better question. Why am I not allowed to say I matter? I am white
looters who bring children to crimes should be charged with child abuse
These kids are so smart and sweet and pure and holy crap
So the idea of this was that no matter what caste
I would disagree... but that‚Äôs just my opinion I feel like third world countries have a vast variety of problems such as poverty
‚ÄúI don‚Äôt agree with like homosexuality‚ÄùnSweetie I got something to tell you
colorbar.s yeah they are putting a lot of stereotypes on her

In some ways I am glad all this happened
Black lives matter and all lives matter. Justice can be done without destroying property and defunding Police departments. America is to good for that
she is fearful.
@Jody I'm not even gonna awnser dumb questions I mean COME ON PEOPLE DONT YOU SEE THIS HUGE DIVIDE?
I came here because i can never shake the thought when i said to someone that i want to be an engineer but got a respond That's for boys man was i so discouraged
First coronavirus and now protests.nF**king hate 2020.nSave hong kongers
A great german singer wrote a Song about that  check it out on YouTube  Black lives Matter  Amadeus
They are so racist...nAll going black lives matter
I was at one of these protests and can guarantee that these people are not all hard lefties  they're just people who care about equality. If equality is a hard left view then maybe we need more left wing people in the world
@Prima Materia really who has all the weapons ü§î our reign is just beginning.

WE WILL NEVER GIVE UP!! LGBTQI+ RISE!!!!
MrCosmin94 I don‚Äôt want to continue this discussion because it isn‚Äôt my place to tell you how to think in the end. I just find it troubling that your first instinct was to put someone down or shut down their beliefs.
@aw man naw it's also a protest to reach the police. But instead of saying hey stop killing black people unreasonably it's saying hey stop killing all people unreasonably. Whites get killed for the same reasons by police
all these men are so pissed off hbhdb
TheLadyDelirium Mr100duke and so on
Too much plastic surgery.  She looks disturbing.   And disturbed.
She has not expresion on her face
I'm sorry you are scared.  I hope they will be supportive.
@Jay2luv(J.Evans) nHe doesn't know her at all he's making a judgement against a quarter of all society because he's been brainwashed.
why must you have so much hatred in your heart
Eugene Birukov all lives matter is also a racists slogan.
This comment is exactly the problem... Let the show go on. As if anyone can label this as communist and be so confident they‚Äôre correct in their judgement. That‚Äôs so God-knows-how-many-years ago. We‚Äôre in 2020. The greatest crackdown in history
@cashwad Thank you. I hope the voices of reason prevail and Americans will show such brotherly love for each other the question of who matters seems absurd.
+Ancient Soul too bad I never said anything about racism. Moron. This also has nothing to do with anyone that needs help. Obviously everyone matters. When people support breast cancer do you  then complain and say
According to leftists you can‚Äôt say ‚ÄúWhiteLivesMatter‚Äù because it‚Äôs ‚Äúracist‚Äù but it‚Äôs ok to say ‚ÄúBlackLivesMatter‚Äù . The fact that people get called racists for saying ‚ÄúAllLivesMatter‚Äù proves that there is an ‚Äúanti-white‚Äù agenda and It‚Äôs absolutely disgusting! Whenever a White person dies it‚Äôs never on the news and anyone who says ‚ÄúWhiteLivesMatter‚Äù even with respect towards white victims who are targeted for being white in black neighbourhoods is called racist. Where is this movement in Asian
Olivia Tyler isn‚Äôt that like a huge closet? Cause if yes then I have an incredibly huge closet with many clothes.

Stephen Roche. if that's what you can take from this you're pretty pathetic.
@patrick guerette I am not shaming anyone. I am simply voicing my opinion
This comments
It was 80 YEARS after black people were given the right to vote that the Indigenous People of America were given ANY form of recognition. So
It seems that the only time people ever say ‚Äúall lives matter‚Äù is when they are retaliating against someone saying ‚Äúblack lives matter‚Äù. Of course all lives matter
Why does fox news always side with Republicans well thank god except for now because Trump is a piece of poop
AA Productions the former‚Äôs true

@A G  Then use slogan Black lives matter too
If it wasnt for the slave trade i would not have had my lovely 18th century  D-end dining table

Libertarians can disqualify him on the basis that his free anarchic actions affect too many of other people's rights and space. And it's like Brexit
So much virtue-signalling.
The native american indians lives matter.nThe asian lives matter.nThe white man lives matter.nThe black lives matter too..nNot to forget babies life in the womb also matters!nAll lives matter dont matter ur colour
@elhaf Maybe she should be a good engineer and try not casting herself as a victim.
@JP Song what does that have to do with blm movement?

Andrew Stewart this video is from 2015
Matt S yes cause how do we see it and know it idiot
I'm sorry that you had to go through that. And get more bullshit from people.
BLM is racist organisation!!!!!!!
Miles Han So you think only black people can be victins of police brutality? THIS is why we say All Lives Matters. Using your analogy
Love that cop.
What blmnnNooooooooooo  by asian
That's not what it means.
@TheLegend27 Is Alive I'm not going to respect her opinion because she isn't respecting me as a person because of something I can't control. I'm not saying she's going to come out but I am saying I do want her to grow as a person to realize that's kind of a rude way to think about a person.
No you two both don‚Äôt have point
Not my vote your Idiot's
Sunshine littlephilly I think u are nice
I love that they put someone (Annie) in this that  has different beliefs and I totally agree with her
How does one dislike something more than once
The interviewer's really good. Calm
That was my thoughts as well. I was wondering if they are trying to copy buzzfeed.
ALL Lives Matter ü§∑‚Äç... bring it lol.
Im looking forward to sports and then i will forget all bout....whats they name again
‚ÄúGOD gave us a choice my choice is Love!‚Äù nI want a T-Shirt!
@Maggie Paul do you know if black and obeying what the officer is demanding and not resisting arrest will not get you killed!!!!!!
no mustache Lionel Richie in the middle
I trust in Madonna. That's all.
So lucky to be alive in a time this lady is. She is LEGENDARY  Thank you Madonna.
LOOK......there's Minneapolis FIVE YEARS AGO.
She saved mine as well. Thank you with all my heart
@whatcanisay3 I figured the Student's failure... quote would inform that my comment was sarcastic. I guess you just can't be subtle with some people.
when addicts go to rehab they get help
Untrue. African didn't have means to come to Europe to get traders and back to Africa.  Neither was there a communication  between Europe and Africa at that time ? It's the European whom came to Africa to kill and steel.  Don't listen to propaganda bcs the whole world knows what the European did to peaceful African. God punishment is there man.
How was he a terrorist?
@Andrew Smith
If anyone boos/feels offended when someone says All lives matter.nnThey are Racists. Period.
I'm from Brazil and I am studying materials engineering too
Push Factor there are different ways to be homophobic. You don‚Äôt have to be outright hateful to be homophobic. And saying you don‚Äôt support a lifestyle is still condemning it on a smaller scale. That‚Äôs homophobic
What did they delete?
I came out when I was 10 I‚Äôm 11 now
@JP Morgan Agree Baby. And you're alive? Lets Go?
Note the BLM cancelled the London march yesterday
Shut up Madonna. You are a big phony and hypocrite. You stand for ALL that is evil and wicked according to the Bible. nnStop calling EVIL Good and Good Evil. The fear of the Living God is to depart evil but fools despise wisdom and instruction. The ONLY Hope for humanity is not sexuality
@Username 123 there's a difference between being offended and being proud of your history
Excuse me. Dont be negative.
God bless this woman
A day when ALL lives are Gender indifferent.
Feel free. It's an Alien ideology. Nothing wrong with that.
Its Democrats who play victim but hurt get these fucks outta office
People are mistaking difference between the POLITICAL PARTY Black Lives Matter
@iluvfood120 yes! The world needs more people like you I personly believe in my own morals but I have lots of Christian friends and would never bash them for their beliefs
That's exactly what it already IS ...and always has been! And anyone with an IQ higher than their age already knows this!
@you are totally right
Wouldn't that be amazing if everyone came out of lockdown to show support in human kind with All Lives Matter?  If we ALL felt included!!  But no. such horrible timing too. So many are struggling globally but its all focused on BLM. ITs making people actually start up racism
@Pog Champ --Hot Ice it would be completely fair to shout ‚ÄúBlack Lives Matter‚Äù if black people were being 'systemically oppressed'.nnIt is also completely fair to shout Black Lives Matter to a system that is overall showing that they matter much less than other
Its not controversial its equality to all people through the US constitution
Can I just say that  it's not only black people who have surfed in life what about the news in the halacoust
Richard Littler how?
see that's where you're wrong. I have done research and I read philosophy all the time. Imagine if there are 3 houses burning
Sea Doggo Maeve Quinn was the one who originally posted. Who knows who is right? You may be or I may be.
ChunkyStyle22 sexism & racism work on the subconscious level and with confirmation biases! nnI'm not a tech worker but the thing I am VERY concerned with is if say Silicon Valley (considered a bastion of liberalism) has a workforce that only consist say white males that are programming machines to learn in turn wouldn't the unintended consequences for the say AI to learn societal biases and past them onto every sect of society??  nnThe ONLY solution would be is to require quotas and that is considered unconstitutional! nnSo what are we to do? nnIt's a challenge & I don't think being tribal about it is the answer!nnAll I see is folks playing identity politics on these videos and no solutions!
That statue should have been sprinkled with Corona before the gang of savages turned up
Isn't that toilet thing over 10 years old? I'm pretty sure no one gave a fuck about it and it just faded away
But they do matter isnt that a no brainer what has happened to society now these US issues are spilling over Europe because of these anti government Anarchists
Dude's just stop trying so hard to solve racism
All that happens to men too so why aren't they talking about it?
Like the Statue of Saddam Hussein in 2003
Skin colour always wins. Its immediately obvious so it nets you a nice pile of oppression or privilege points.
cop hit it on the head
Free boat rides back to Africa for all black people?  who don't repect this country!!
I really hate the idea of conversation camp and torture with bible and all that stuff
ALL LIVES MATTER ngreetings from germany
hmm... i saw a lot of our white people there too... Look who carried the statue. 2 whites.
I hate this so much! LIKE PEOPLE DYING BECAUSE OF BEING BLACK! SOME BLACK PEEPS ARE EVEN SCARED TO BE OUTSIDE! DONT ALL LIVES MATTER?! CUZ RIGHT NOW IT DOESN‚ÄôT SEEM LIKE IT! #BlackLivesMatter
I'm black and proud but this is not right we should embrace the past because were it not for the slave trader most of Africans in the UK would not be there
Karen Armand I agree with you totally! Well said so typical. Imagine telling Madonna that rubbish to her face? She would laugh at this quack!
Thank you so much from the UK ‚Äç
@Optimus Prime floyd was a crimminal
All lives matter we are all the same if you feel any different sham on you all lives matter I dont see color  I see a person when I look at others it doesn't matter what your skin color is we have got to love each other and stop letting evil control us
All lives matter God loves all his children
vercigentorix M I think you forgot to say ‚Äûand proud of my sisters and brothers who just happen to have black skin.‚Äú Because if you don‚Äôt feel like that
@Vanesa Look guys a priest who has never done a mistake in his entire life.
This shit is crazy!!!! How does every life not matter!!! They take these slogans and brainwash people with them.. PEOPLE ALL LIVES MATTER... IT DOESNT MATTER WHAT COLOR YOUR SKIN IS. STOP LETTING THESE PSYCHOS DIVIDE US...
I love maths and science and I hate princess
Respect all life from the womb to the tomb

@Lorenna Kocijancic evil as in criminal or evil as in declared evil by someone?
the little girl with the long hair and striped shirt is actually a 45-year-old grandmother.
No lives matter we're born to die
I will start conversion therapy‚Äôs in my area and around the nation. We need to help these lgbt people out before it‚Äôs to late
Fig whites are discriminated today
@Lorenna Kocijancic yea... i Wrote a rather random question apparently. But you wholeheartedly replied and answered. Ok cool. No i hate peanutbutter. Tastes aweful without chocolete cream. Or Jam.
BLM? Instead of buying a new BMW
@aussiebear22¬†ok yes Hillary is probably a joke of a candidate but I don't presume to know about US politics. That's not because she advocates for feminism
Louis Mariano   maybe she needs Boniva
what Jesus?  i know a Mexican with that name...
I don‚Äôt agree with LGBT
Lockjaw great way of putting it
I totally agree with the boy at 3
Alien invasion or an astreroid?
Madonna is the PHONIEST person on earth. She is absolutely selfish and vile!!!
I can't count the ways I admire her...
It's one thing to ideally believe that all lives matter
@Caleb Hollingsworth I saw your little video of a coward bully sucker punching a boy. You have that idiot a thumbs up.  That says a lot about your racist thug attitude. Grow up.
Maybe it's because they knew that black people were unjustified for over 200 years
why do you say that
@Randy Shephard its not an opinion mate
I offer my respect to everybody who respects me. Even when I'm stupid.
‚ÄúBlack lives matter.‚Äù Notice how it doesn‚Äôt say ‚ÄúAll lives don‚Äôt matter ‚Äú or ‚ÄúBlack lives are better.‚Äù The message being carried out by the BLM community is that our country has oppressed and undervalued Black lives for generations. Black lives matter is a movement intended to shed light on this social issue which has corrupted our justice system
Quite obviously the 'radicals' here are the far left
That's soooo inspiring Thank u for those words and for ur sharing ur succesful experience ! I hope to see more female engineers around in the future
@Ed Monteith¬†typical liberal
It‚Äôs not controversial to say all lives matter which they do. The controversy comes with the President
It's called social decadence bro. Failing education system and lack of family are the roots of these problems in my opinion
I would like to point out that statistics show the greatest aggressors against black Americans is in fact themselves.... unfortunately according to a liberal Dr numbers/statistics/mathematics is racist
Real question to the democrats should've been 'do babies lives in the womb matter? Well done
Why don't you ask her? I don't tell my male relatives about all of the sexism I've been subjected to. There's too much of it.  It's not like every time I'm wronged by a man I pick up the phone
@tooth bat hopefully so
@Hey McFly There were a mix of masks on display. I think it's fair to say. The point being that clearly coronavirus has not gone away in the minds of people. It is still a thing.
My cousin is pansexual. Pan sexual. It‚Äôs a joke we have
@Anthony Quintero THANK YOU
For once I do not agree with Bernie.
bluediamondminer You obviously didn't understand what she said. Get off of YouTube and go to school and get your dumb ass educated.

It is a Transgender ! A Man !
She is so full of herself. She wishing she can keep her soul ..  Only thing she has wrapped up at this moment is the truth
Repzion took the sexism test too and you guys said the exact same thing throughout
Ashton Levry if anything that should make you proud of this country because we're actually trying to leave the old ways and make it better
Only black lives matter and no one else. White people are unimportant because they are white! Black people are important cause they are black! = not racistnAll lives matter equally! = racist. nAnyone else see an issue or am i just insane??
@Javitomanzano Read your book. For once do what it tells you to do and you shall be enlightened. Throw her off a roof
American values need to be restored
It's called a Victim Fight. Dr Randomercam loves to highlight them.
your account screams 10-13 year old
I thought the presbiterian boy was going to came out as a lesbian girl.
Twats don't forget to blow up the pyramids in Giza since they were built by slaves.
I reckon the girl in the maroon jumper is in denial
Jesus some of these replies show that some of you guys are racist but say y‚Äôall aren‚Äôt
That sheriff is awesome just saying
LOL why does people have to criticize everything? I'm just admiring her and stating that she's also beautiful because not everyone has the whole package like she does. You need to either be naturally gifted or put in a lot of effort to attain these things. I'm inspired because she breaks stereotypes such as girls cannot be engineers/be good at math and of course that stereotype is used even more to judge pretty girls in a society where pretty girls are encouraged to become models or celebrities.
Because unarmed black men are killed by police in huge numbers compared to whites. See the difference!
don't tempt fate bro. wait...yeah no...lol tempt the fuck out of it.
Thats different u dumbass
He wasn't a criminal
Thankfully police are also going away so I can just drive off casually
You have got to keep up the lgbtq hahahaha
I am bachelor in cybernetics and robotics
@xThisUsernameIsTakenNowx who cares if a hate group is suppressed
in 1981 Robin Williams closed a show at Carnegie hall with one very poignant question where do I donate to the united caucasian college fund?
The world is truly fucked.
@Alex Rivas well said
So lucky to be alive in a time this lady is. She is LEGENDARY  Thank you Madonna.
All lives matter! nRacist booing*nWhy are you booing me
YEAH it is.... and 90% of WHITES  want it !
@Sushi Because they're children.
Dad equality? how is a millionaire black rapper equal to a white college student deep in loan debt... right?
I‚Äôm white and I wouldn‚Äôt vote for him. Does that make me racist?
conversion therapy is disgusting and should be very much illegal
@chris chris if thats what you think !!
Jessica S what classes are you taking
I am white and male and not an immigrant.
It should be poor lives matter!The reason this is happening is because the poor neighborhoods that in the inner city are majority Africa Americans and the black market of the illigal sale of drugs. Cause violent addiction gangs etc. It's been happening so long that it's become apart of the. culture.  Yet Hollywood the music industry glamerize it to our youth. It's simple you stop this war on drugs and than the over policing of these communities who've been caught in the middle and forced to take side will end and we'll be able to truly heal as a nation.
The girl with short hair seems confused
That doesn't make what the cop did right.
The reason Bernie failed is buying into this blm bs
its sad to see black people sell out for white people
God gave us a choice. My choice is to love. nI teared up. He is my role model
It‚Äôs disgusting year
She looks younger than 2015/2016
Why survivor tho? Not trying to be mean
Well I'm white and my life and family's lives matter. Proud white American here.
GmV-arts How come I hear that exact same analogy every single time someone says all lives matter? It‚Äôs like that analogy is a programmed response with people like you.
I thought racism was coming to an end and all of a sudden this kind of bullshit comes around i hate our government they twist shit to fit their agenda
White racists shut up
Separating people for a political agenda matters.
@Debbieb2021 Brownn You sound so ignorant and stupid Deborah.nn There is systematic racism in America
You‚Äôre so strong and I‚Äôm so happy you can be yourself. This means so much
All lives matter were all human bottom  Line..... people are stupid....
All lives matter we all eat bleed the same. To think otherwise is racist.
I have personally lived in Silicon Valley and I know that this video doesn't represent the politics of Silicon Valley. It is one of the most liberal places in the world.
Then God will hit you with the bible yelling that's not what I meant lol
She looks like she's taken a lot of valium.
@Hi Qwerty but we have proof and u don't and just because one of her followers was a shooter doesnt meanshesupports shootings nand if ur gonna talk about white on black violence then talk about the veteran officer (who is black)who got shot and killed by the rioters
Bob Marley & The Wailers - Funeraln
So if you had one black parent and one white parent does your life only half matter? nTwo thumbs up to the sheriff.
With a book
The world is not just America
George Floyd was a violent criminal who was resisting arrest. USA Police are tough. Never resist arrest and answer all there questions. That‚Äôs for people of all colour.
I like to shout out to Cher who has Transgender child and who call Madonna not a nice person and mean . She has done more than you did for lgbtq community and you should be thankful for that and see that behind that mean mask of her there is a beautiful heart and not everything we see is actually what it really is .
LI Every GOOD Person..
I think that there is an issue with police but I don't think it's racial I strictly think that police brutality is an issue that faces EVERYONE regardless of color or race I do believe that most of this stuff is really stupid and people are too politically blinded to see the other side of the coin
Sheriff David Clark and Larry are great men.... great minds..... I could listen to them all day.... Subscribed to Larry years ago.... Irish fan of both men...
Uh oh your white privilege is showing
@Erick Mandujano welp look whos homophobic
Before my heavenly father   all  all lives matter for we are all his children . God created man in his own image

Can we just go back to the 90s
Goldieblox is a niche it won't beat barbie. Trying to overcome nature is hard.nnIt is also hard to out sell Burgers with healthy salads. Just look at the burger chains around the world. May be to overcome them we can have salad chains.
BLACK LIVES MATTER I don‚Äôt know why they are like that
@Magik  People still follow science books that are hundreds of years old and they believe the things in the science books that they read about. I go by what the bible teaches and I am not brainwashed because I didn't always go by what the bible said. I started going by it
This woman is the real deal. Yep
would jesus be called racist if he camed down to day and said all live matter
I was so scared to come out
@LoveofVelvet What's yours?
She is not and never has been afraid to speak out against homophobia  because her herself us bisexual .
Natalie Klein she‚Äôs so obnoxious when she gets excited tho like in some videos

Madonna didn't even write her own music nor did she save any of you. She does whatever gives her publicity.
@EliasTTA If someone is against my entire sexuality
Remember it was black tribes in Africa who sold other black tribes to the slave traders.

There‚Äôs only 2 genders // Change my mind
There is no way Annie is straight

@Lola Foxx where did she seem close minded and judgmental though? She even stated she still loves
Half assed accent! Stop fixing my words!

Anyone can agree or disagree with it
Wait conversion therapy is still a thing???
@xXX_ DANKITY_DOGE _XXx You are absolutely right all lives matter

They are self-hating hypocrites that hide under religious righteousness... ignore them
@Harry Kavanagh I know because the bible says there is ONE GOD. God said to have no other gods
@Zackary Shepard he's trolling you. And false flagging trying to get a reaction. Anyone can say only x lives matter. But it seems you can publicly say white lives don't matter as a professor and get away with it.
Notice bow proud of  this the sky narrator sounds about it
Change equals challenge... wow
@Al Nevermind We need more people like you in our world. Why cant all religious people be like you? You are doing what God wants you to do.

+Natalie Miller-And you were more than likely raised that way and raised to believe something like that. It was something you knew and accepted. This is the way things work. This is how things are supposed to work. And hiding/concealing/denying that part of yourself probably added so much fuel to the fire. There may have been something wrong with you. You knew how things were supposed to be

@Sul that makes no sense whatsoever. So to you people who were abused(mentally and physically) and still lived from it and overcame it aren't survivors? Being abused is the same as getting out of bed in the morning?

Never give up what? They have more rights now than a person with traditional wholesome Values.

Marguerite Kenny The name thing isn‚Äôt really a racial issue though. It‚Äôs an interesting study but not one that proves racism.nnIt also still doesn‚Äôt change the fact that blacks are chosen for jobs far more often than whites nowadays. Hell

You mean he is the perfect example of a man!
I couldn‚Äôt agree more. This mob has just gone out and followed the rioting heard desires over the wishes of the rest of the general public who don‚Äôt want this to continue. This is a matter for the US to deal with. This is not a UK problem. Although if this continues much longer then it certainly will be. Unfortunately
After Trump's run is over
I was totally getting lgbtq vibes from that girl who didn't really agree with homosexuality lol
All lives matter to the  self empowered  black  man.  Black lives matter to the black man  who blames and does not take responsibility.
I am not so sure about that there has been a huge upswing among young people in becoming concerned about the environment and the effects of climate change .
nobody cares what you think...
What colour was Michael Jackson.  I thought he was dark skinned as a kid  and a young man. Did he Whiteface    isn't that racist

All lives matter. but right now black lives are being taken everyday in the more horrific way I have two sons and one is 5 years old and one is 10 months old I wonder will I go to work and not make it home one day tension in the streets are so thick you can cut it with a butter knife. we're all human at the end of the day peace and love may we get through this together.

No lives matter to the 1%.
I love how black people are calling em innocent. it's hilarious! plus they also ignore how blacks kill whites all the time and blacks kill blacks all the time and they don't seem to care.
Surely that just means that white people need to get out there and protest against police brutality....like they are doing right now.
theres nothing wrong with it its just a thing that people in the lgbt community cos most people do that
@Evil Insecticon you can't concede that it's an issue and follow that up by downplaying it into irrelevancy. There's been articles that try to show that it's rare
The damage this is doing to the non white communities is incalculable. The Democratic agenda is there for all to see.....open your eyes.

What a wonderful story. Congratulations on your persistence in bringing your vision into the world
This debate is so inane...¬†Obviously all lives matter. The phrase Black lives matter is not suggesting that only black lives matter. It is a response to a set of institutions and actions that consistently infer that black lives don't matter. The fact is

So she basically realized that all the guys in the class are doing well because they study till 3 in the morning??

Any affirmative action for males available

THIS WAS VERY INSPIRATIONAL TO ME
The 1800s 1833 to be specific was when the British Empire abolished slavery and also sent out the royal navy to stop American slave trading ships. Also the statue was built in 1895 but the person in the statue died 174 years before it was built.

@Heather More madonna fans agree with you yes because they'd say that she looked great however she looked but I doubt whether more people think that a big swollen face looks better than a face with a few age lines and wrinkles. But then who knows.

She's a confident woman ... People hate that .. they see it as a threat and want to take her down.. jealously ...

I love how the kids are not judgemental

What's the point of adding -Straight guy?nThat's no big deal. Many straight men wanted to bang her.
I'll take it that there will be a video on the rampant sexism in primary school education that both male pupils and teachers alike face seeing as how you are against sexism?
A Macmillanrn1 second agornAbsolutely!  They're effectively defeating their cause by turning people against them.
This kind of mob rule is totally wrong and those who did it are no better than the man the statue was feting
Unsubscribing. Thanks for ruining a great Channel. We come here for the great videos. Not to see you jump on the bandwagon and take the stance that apparently only black people matter right now because magically there's a switch that we can all turn on and make black people 100% equal. People being equal starts with crap like this ending and if you stop talking about everyone being racist and just treated people how they are we wouldn't even have the word anymore. But everybody these days has to be labeled something and a part of something so they feel special so that way they all get a trophy when they go home. Goodbye Channel you had a lot of wonderful videos

What do you mean looks the gayest? A lot of women have short hair and cuffed jeans and are straight.
You're always in style Madonna. Love you so much. .
Finally the sheriff showed up on real news unlike when he was on CNN and got cut off smh
Outside of the USA it has had some effects. The problem is that people think
Chanting for violence against Police is not to benefit of anyone is it. They should go after their Mayor and Govenors for better training for peace keepers and rescuers.
I think the reason we see so many Sheriffs speaking facts on the news like this is because they are enough of a normal human where they have a idea of what‚Äôs going on in the world but not powerful enough where they are only out for their own political and financial gain

@Dad where? When? Every nation and every country experienced slavery. There has been slavery in Africa and the Middle East for thousands of years and still is today.. Many of them white too. Yes there was slavery in America for a few hundred years. 150 years ago. And a half a million white men fought and died to free them. Every immigrant population has been discriminated against. Italians were spat on when they crossed through Ellis Island in the early 1900's. But if you don't think you are a victim you won't be one. Maybe it's time to relax and be happy America is the best place in the world for ANYONE to succeed.

I feel like saying black lives matter is just segregation really.anyone and everyone should just come together. Then say look every human matters in life. but of course saying that I'm automatically deemed a racist. even though I don't have any hatred against anyone.thats a different color but what do I know. I just want peace between every person but that'll never happen. so we have to actually look at this with real facts.hatred will always exist violence will always exist. unfortunately that is our human nature. live life to its fullest make the best of it. Hopefully one day we can all look beyond our skin color and just get along.

Randall Sims Who are the way that you‚Äôre talking about?
+bluefavorites Hahah I think it's really funny that you are trying to make it look like  I just sit at by computer and complain. for the record I am trying to help. I do a lot of volunteer work with people in need of help with. I donate money when I can. I'm planning on  becoming a teacher or social worker bc then I can make a living and help people in major need of help. I know that's a small scale but hey
I am a Presbyterian and for the record as a denomination we except the lgbtq community.

Molly Rebekah hey I‚Äôm a Christian too and I wanna say that I‚Äôm sorry how everyone is testing you but if you are a kind and loving Christian then wouldn‚Äôt you want to respect people‚Äôs sexual orientation because that is something no one has control over but then again I am not one to judge your character I‚Äôm sure your very good have a nice day fellow Christian #gayrights

Nothing wrong with conversion therapy
What an amazing talk from an amazing person. Human beings are more complex than what we Americans are giving women- and men alike- credit for. And it starts from an early age. As a substitute teacher I always try to make the girls understand that it's ok for me to dress feminine and like pink while also liking working hard and trying to be good at skills we aren't being encouraged towards.

this was a really nice vid to see after all those disturbing police violence vids
African Americans being persecuted doesn't somehow lower the value of other ethnicity. That is asinine. Saying all lives matter doesn't in any way state or imply that those issues shouldn't be addressed. Poverty is color blind though

She's probably just parroting the opinions of her parents. As she grows up she might begin to view things differently.
The slogan all lives matter is associated with a narrative that has some pretty reprehensible undertones. It's not racist to condemn it for that reason.
Petra Paviƒçiƒá She dresses just  like Ellen degrees. She could be straight though idk. I saw this one buzzfeed video where this lesbian lady was answering the questions that people didn‚Äôt know about lesbians. She looks exactly like her almost.
Which is wrong because in the Bible and a lot of other religious books say that it's wrong
Daniel T your gonna have to leave your house for once and check out what‚Äôs going on in the real world

Because you are going to be labeled as a racist or a bigot if you deem to say those words All lives Matter originally I supported the peaceful protest of black lives matter because of police brutality
Bottom line is all lives matter. BLM is nothing more than a terrorist group
@wow i am lost no prob racist in some way nafter all he is white !
He was an odious toad.

@Alex Rivas the phrase black lives matter suggests racial superiority. It excludes the importance of anybody else's life.
What is wrong with people? This had nothing to do with George Floyd and BLM anymore. It has become about a political statement and people trying to clean their history slat and it's WAAAY too later for that.  Innocent cops are paying the price for the racist jackass cops. Also

All lives matter was created to protest black lives matter. I'm pretty sure everyone can agree that all lives matter. except they won't matter until black lives matter
Hipocrisy!!! Majority in Europe they're racists. Don't received.

I don't see the difference no matter the race your living breathing you exist. And you matter your a life!  your life matters. Each and every life counts in this life there's no difference. And there's no excuse to say that one life is more important then another's because that's just not true.

You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.
Maybe try to be a native there to understand it
This is literally me

@Beau James Except 'books' from those times were actually rolls of papyrus which are incredibly hard to preserve. The only reason we were able to learn from those statues is because they were made from either marble or bronze so they physically lasted a long time. Nowadays we not only have durable books but also almost every piece of text is digitalised aswell. I think the message the protestors are trying to show is that they don't want them displayed like hero's on the streets. (Although I agree any statue should be demolished legally and stored in museums of some sort)

All lives matter undercuts from the BLM movement. The reason why BLM exists is because Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police force. If there's a burning house you would try to save it

Squirty Splash nYes Ameb!
We are NOT saying all other lives don't matter. We are saying that we matter too. Because this American system seems not to care about black lives compared to other racial groups. And also just because you are black and yell all lives matter you're just as ignorant and just because you are black doesn't make it a stamp of approval. Educate yourself on why It's the label of the movement . It's only those who want to take away from it's meaning that say all lives matter to water down the serious issue. I suggest you take several seats
Not only were they not erasedNon_hope_speech
What cowards! To Pander to a certain minority group even when the facts don't back it up.
This is stupid! All lives matter is not in any way ignoring the black community! Why do we not hear about other forms of slavery in American history books! Involving different races. Racism exists against all racist. Every race is racist. And to generalize that blacks are the only in poverty situations. I'm white. I'm not proud of it but I have little money for food. There are poor people of all races. And to generalize so much in this video is very dumb because clearly no one has the full knowledge of everything that is happening. It appearantly would be wrong to say Muslim lives matter because people are so stuck in this idea of black lives matter that is actually causing more diversity
We need a new way of doing it is terrible how it currently is but we should have it for people who are either transitioning or transitioning back because there are some instances of people not wanting to be the gender they transitioned into and may want to become their previous physical gender apearance

@Bobby Bobster Police bending the knee is also a political statement which the police are supposed to be A-political.

I love how they gave the slightly homophobic kid waaayyy less screen time than all of the supportive ones.
@A G every group in the world is global. The devil is doing his job.
Cooperating with police investigations matters. Cleaning up your own communities matters.
@nas84payne Im not sure if the blm should get the statues they want since they defaced many historic statues. I say make a new version of the statue and use the broken one as a humiliation to show how disgusting humans can be.
@HiYa Pal nAll Lives Matter is a gimmick used by the jealous ones to prevent the discussion of racism. Jealousy is the sole cause of anti-black racism
George Floyd was a criminal
@Killua Zoldyk nWell normal black people have only 2 ways. 1st way is to distance themselves from that cancerous community. 2nd is to change that community. Simple as that. Until you do that white people will have prejudices about both - thugs and those who look like thugs. You can't change it - all humans tend to generalize and simplify things
Anna it‚Äôs a joke? lgbt people can joke about stereotypes about themselves calm down

@Epilith It's not like taking down a statue is erasing all information about him.  nThat statue is a sign of respect for a racist slave trader
J Brown because what they are saying is that every human life on earth matters
Thomas Lane! He got away!
BLM is a huge scam based on lies.
People argue you can't say All Lives Matter when black people are not feeling like they matter. But then why can you say Black Lives Matter if black people feel like they don't matter? If black lives still aren't mattering even with people chanting Black lives matter
Turkey Lives Mattern
I didn't grow up racist. In fact
All lives fucking matter. Saying black lives matter only adds to the diversity

As long as she doesnt get too near the radiator
you dont really need to tell them if you don't feel safe doing so. you dont owe them your truth and especially so if they won't treat it with respect and love. nif you absolutely feel like you want to tell them despite it all
The statue was not the initial problem. The plaque below the statue read
@Vlogchannel now in america racism merely an accusation by most black people. Not one other race mistreats blacks but alot of them still points their finger.
The straight black guy automatically loses privilege points for not being gay while the gay black guy has the disadvantage (or advantage depending on how you look at it) of less privilege points from both his gayness and his blackness. Even though the straight black guy still loses privilege points after accounting for his blackness the gay black guy still comes out on top since his gayness in combination with his blackness automatically nets him less privilege points overall making this a hate crime against just homosexuals. Not against black homosexuals though
@Nancy Kavanagh  I have been kind
BLM chanted how they were just yearning for cops to die
Please direct me to where these women are getting promoted with no merit. On two separate occasions I was asked to prove my education and experience for tech jobs. Both times

@tom - girl Yes they do
TJ still believes /pol/ is an elaborate troll instead of a troll that's gone too far and horribly wrong.
@CadaverJunkynseriously do you live in a bubble? There's no way to ever truly get rid of bigoted ideas. They're going to exist regardless of what you want. The main difference between you and me is that I realized that a very long time ago so when someone shows themselves to be homophobic I tend not to hang around them. I have that choice. Being American is neat like that.

Because most prominent figures from history where involved in the slave trade or owned slaves from the the vikings to the roman emperors to George Washington. This was 300+ years ago and at the time his business would have been considered perfectly acceptable by most of his contemporaries. In our more civilized age we all know its not acceptable to discriminate because of race religion or anything else but we cant simply judge the actions of our ancestors by the morals established by todays society. I am certain 300 years from now many things that we do every day and consider perfectly moral and normal will be looked on with discust and many things we consider aphorant will be widely accepted and practiced. Edward Colston was a member of parliment for Bristol and used his money to build schools and hositals for the poor of bristol thats why he was commemorated with this statue.
ANYONE can do and become ANYTHING they please. Sad that this is even a problem in society. Why can't we all work together and succeed as a whole?

@Michael Paysour lowest form of human being ever to live on planet earth? entitled liberals cant either back up their facts or their misinformed and just about most of them r kids so what do u mean lmao
No.. black lives matter doesnt mean other races dont matter. It means is making awareness of white privileges... it's as if you were playing soccer and you broke your leg.. and the coach comes over and says all broken legs matter and starts checking everyone else's leg.. it's the simple point that all lives matter is defeating the purpose of trying to make a change in the black community
