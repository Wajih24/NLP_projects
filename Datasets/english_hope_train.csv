So are white lives matter and asian lives matter. Black lives matter in this context is simply the name of a movement against the strangely high rate of police violence on black people and the statement is referring to those who behave like and treat black people as if they dont matter. For example	Non_hope_speech

@Amazing Worenwu all lives means we are all equal	Hope_speech	
+Ancient Soul oh Lord. I don't think you'll ever understand. There's a specific context in which the black lives matter movement arose. Because black people were being killed and there were multiple incidents of the same type of thing. What exactly is the context for the all lives matter movement and focusing on the whole world? It was only created as a combatant otherwise it wouldn't even exist. No one is blaming white people. We're saying stop killing black people unjustly. That's it. Obviously there are other problems going. Probably more important ones too. But are people not allowed to stand up for themselves without being attacked? Would you not like to be able to stand up for yourself without being opposed? That's all this is about but sadly I don't think you'll be able to understand no matter which way I put it	Hope_speech

@Jamie Ryan Storey i think Madonna holds a bigger grudge than Cyndi does on her.  Cyndi always speaks highly of Madonna and i find it odd (again) almost every interview with Cyndi .. Madonna is brought up in the conversation .. but with Madonna interviews; no mention of Cyndi.  One thing that would be difficult to accomplish with both them in the same room working on a project; discipline.  Madonna IS very disciplined.  Cyndi is scattered.  But both are very creative and passionate about their work.  Definitely two worlds colliding.	Non_hope_speech

It‚Äôs ashamed that you were met with ridicule after saying ‚ÄúAll lives matter‚Äù.  I don‚Äôt agree with trashing someone who may not understand the cause. In short saying ‚Äú All lives matter‚Äù in response to ‚ÄúBlack lives matter‚Äù can come off as dismissive and purposefully missing the point. BLM at its core is not meant to divide or ridicule but to bring awareness. Hopefully your conversations on the subject (should you continue to have one) end with more acceptance and understanding rather than anger and insults. Best of luck	Non_hope_speech

All lives matter doesn‚Äôt make no logical sense because it‚Äôs white people who are suffering. BLM is like saying Black Lives matter too. It‚Äôs not saying Only Black Lives Matter. Too say all lives matter or white lives matter isn‚Äôt rational and of course you are gonna get booed. It‚Äôs because white people are being killed by the police for no reason. White people arent being discriminated against. White people got it made. Not all white people but the majority of America is white people. And not even 100 years ago my grandpa couldn‚Äôt use the same restrooms as white people. So saying all lives matter is like a chicken protesting against the wolf and the wolf saying their life matters too. Of course it does. But it‚Äôs not what the movement is about. So please shut up when you say all lives matter. No matter what you mean by it.	Non_hope_speech

#BlackLivesMatter isnt about being better than other races its about making people aware of what black people go through that other groups don't.

@t0bias busterud You are missing my point. I find it impossible to understand that a movement that is trying to redress inequality has a main banner statement  of inequality. I am not putting the importance of any race over any other. The statement White Lives Matter is just as wrong as Black Lives Matter. I am sure the movement has some valid points but the cause is not helped by a provocative banner. All Lives Matter would be perfect for the movement because it wouldn't diminish the impact and it would show absolute unity and equal opportunity for everyone going forward. I believe this would garner additional support from all areas of all communities.	Hope_speech	
Kudos to Wired for not trying to stifle and censor discussion although I had to check to see if I accidentally clicked on a Buzzfeed link.

@SepherStar Well I would partly disagree. Even train drivers in the US are known as engineers as apart from driving train engines they are expected to know the nitty gritties of their engines as well as troubleshoot engine problems when in operation. What I meant by working with hands (exaggeration) was that skilled engineers are more hands-on with practical experience on shop floor or on site in case of projects. This is precisely why women are misfits in a field like engineering cuz they are dependent mostly on technicians and do not like to take orders from their managers (submissive attitude) due to ego problems. (Managers would rarely shout orders to female sub-ordinates lest they get sued for sexual harassment... so instead of giving orders to their female sub-ordinates	Non_hope_speech

@Mr. carpenter bee maybe I should have used the word indoctrinate not brainwashed. nobody forces an adolescent to believe in a religion but they are more prone to believing certain views if they grew up with that religion being the norm. But if they leave that community and are able to think outside that norm then they might question several aspects but when someone is under a certain age they just go with the flow of their communities norms unless it causes them pain. There have been many LGBTQ youth in religious communities who are shunned when they come out. Just think of the implications and pressures someone has to go through when their community does not accept them. in my opinion	Non_hope_speech

I just want to point out that the Bible does not say that homosexuality is a sin. The passage that I‚Äôve always seen sited has been proven to be translated incorrectly and is actually condemning pedophilia rather than homosexuality. ‚ÄúMen shall not lay with man‚Äù was originally meant to read as ‚Äúman shall not lay with boy‚Äù. Homosexuality is never condemned. Please do research and learn about the origins of the book you claim to worship.

Isn't the majority of killings of Black lives in America actually by other black individuals?   I highly value Black lives I have traveled to Nigeria twice and to Rwanda twice to teach workshops on how to save newborn babies at birth.  These babies happen to be Black and I have worked in hospitals to save people of all races.   My understanding is there are a whole lot more black lives lost though in the United States due to Violence among the Afro American community in impoverished neighborhoods.   To focus on the police as a critical solution to the loss of Black lives and to take actions that are not precisely calibrated will result in a great increase in the loss of Black lives.   The police have been serving the Black community.   Yes there have been incidences of abuse by police just as there have been nurses that purposefully killed their patients but we don't decide to get rid of nurses because of these few  crazy ones.   After all Black lives matter right?	Non_hope_speech

Daiyan Farrel Keigo Hartono BLM are protesting across Europe and the UK...it‚Äôs not just the USA these protests are occurring.   One of my points is for the BLM spokespersons to look at the big picture and give a voice to modern day slaves who are currently bought and sold from within the African continent.  Asian people are employed under false pretences of employment and forced into the sex trade or slave labour.  So rather than wasting all that energy looting and ripping statues down why don‚Äôt BLM focus and protest on something that‚Äôs happening right now.  Pulling a statue down achieves nothing!

@NOXISUM you really couldn't have been more racist with that comment. I'm African American and I support the all lives matter statement. You sit there and say white people make it about them. Uhhh no it's not just white people its every other non black race and they're not trying to bash this protest. But why can't it just be about police brutality and racism in general. Black people and white people get hated on all the time and that goes the same for Asians and Hispanics. The all lives matter thing is saying police brutality needs to end and so does racism. And do you really think black people aren't racist against white people. I just saw a video of a group of black people beating the sh!t out of white people and setting their cars on fire. Like what kinda response is that. It seems like you think only black people know struggle racially or otherwise and that's just not true.	Hope_speech

For people who were judging Annie (and I read that she has come out now but I'm not sure if that's true) I was the same way when I was younger because I grew up in a religious family. But I was really really confused and hated myself because I couldn't understand why God would hate me if I like girls. Which for me made me try to prove even more that I didn't like girls at all. I finally left the religion two years ago and came out as bisexual. It's really scary if your family is homophobic and tell you that you are damned forever for that...	Hope_speech

@Dirieh Ngongo Black lives mattered since the civil rights act was passed in 1964. Everyone knows black lives matter in the modern day and age. But you cannot shy away from the fact that there are and always will be individual racists by constructing a movement that is completely counterproductive to the African American community. Blaming it on factors such as systematic racism that clearly doesn't exist for black people. Let's take college acceptance for example. A black candidate for being a student in the school premise is more sawn after than a person of yellow colour with the same qualifications. Now tell me how you guys have it worse that isn't of your own doing. By creating this victim mentality you literally take all hope away from them with the lies you radicals have created.	Non_hope_speech	
BLM is indeed an organization who has their own beliefs and stand for different things. But BLM is a statement or phrase that stands for the fact that black lives matter too.

Very reasonable and well thought out. I agree and further more can add that a number such as the ratio of men to women in engineering fields does not show there is a problem. Rather this demonstrates that despite a  level playing field women as a whole don't want to be or may dream about it but are not willing to put in the work as frequently as men are. I was listening to a consultant for law firms talk about female lawyers and the legal field has a hard time hanging on to female partners after 30 years old.

Jeff Davis statistically white people are born in a better economic situation than most black ppl. We also have a higher median income than the black community in every class. Black ppl also have a much lower chance of being accepted for a traditional mortgage.

I didn't even know I liked programming until I took an intro cs course during my senior year of high school. nI always knew I had kind of an engineering mentality growing up because I liked taking scraps from the recycling bin and building random things from it. I even made houses for my dolls and ignored the store bought doll house my parents gave to me for my birthday.nThis really inspires and reassures me that I'm making the right choices for my path.

Wow another good TED speech but what I find shocking are some of the comments. You would think that by 2014 we wouldn't even be having these debates.n2014 and we are still B***t ing and moaning about gender roles.nnThe only weakness for females would be physical. They might struggle doing manual labor such as using a jack-hammer but mentally the are equal to males. Its just the way kids are programed. Most parents don't even do it intentionally but¬†each gender is programed to do certain things so by the time they grow up they are on auto pilot. They can't tell you why they like doing this or that because they were program to do certain jobs while they were young. That's why each gender tend to do certain job.nnIts takes guts to say NO! I will be what I want to be.	Non_hope_speech

We are missing the best female talent. There may be females that are truly interested but not encouraged (as in told about engineering not forced) or bullied out of it (there have been studies that show capable females leave STEM because they are bullied by peers or faculty). I do not force anyone into a field they are not interested in - I have a cousin that would be capable but not interested. I tell her to do what she likes. But there are females that would like it - we need to find them. A diverse workforce makes it a better workforce. Crash tests were only conducted using males dummies until females engineers got involved and saw there needed to be tests on females as well!

Black panthers and last poets were anti-gay. So was Malcolm X. nBlack Lives Matter movement is against the nuclear family and they are pro-marxist as they admit this on their website. This isn't a black movement... it's an LGBTQ movement for gays & pro-welfare state agenda disguised as a black movement. nnBLM remained quiet during the shootings on fathers day where over 100 black on black killings took place. The reason they didn't address it is because they didn't want to bring focus to fathers day as it would go against their beliefs.	Non_hope_speech

Saying All lives matter can be offensive for the same reason black lives matter can be offensive to some.

So obviously¬†to a non racist non black that¬†is a grossly¬†offensive notion.

People say Black lives Matter becasue it is obvious that many Americans think they don't matter.  The slogan does not day Only Black lives mattter.

It has been adopted by racists around the country.  400 years of history (which many refuse to acknowledge) prove that black lives do not matter to many Americans.	Non_hope_speech	
You see the reason for the saying black lives matter is too raise awareness of how many black people are victims of oppression. A better way to put it is Black Lives Matters Too. So when people say all lives matter it is a true statement but contradicts Black Lives Matter.	Non_hope_speech

With so many people thinking that they are God's. If that were true than why don't they see that God looks at everyone with pure love and he filled our world with wonders that all people need to experience like the healing power's of all he created. If all lives matter than we will all prosper as it should be. When only one race matters it is doomed to fail because to actually be a true success all lives unite to combat what's wrong.

I know  there is some sexism in the workforce and there is no doubt about that. But the thing that i hate is that these people are basically saying with all these stupid percentages that men need to change and help women into engineering and men are the problem that there aren't really any women in that field. And that is completely wrong the main reason that there aren't any women in engineering is because women just don't choose to go into that line of work. it's as simple as that.	Hope_speech

There's nothing therapeutic in being hurt or brainwashed. How do we still call those... things therapies ? This is nothing more than legal abuse. Parents who send their child there would say i'm sending my child in a place where they will be abused both mentally and physically if they were honest about themselves.

My opinion...Black LIves Matter is both a phrase as well as a political organization founded by three community activists with a socialist agenda. When you say black lives matter you may believe you are simply supporting a slogan but you are also empowering the leftest organization of that name. According to White House records the organizers were coordinating and meeting with the Obama Administration in the aftermath of Ferguson as the group was being founded and are closely aligned with the Democratic Party. It is clever strategy to use what sounds like a well meaning slogan as the name for a political organization with a much larger agenda.	Non_hope_speech

There was no All lives matter movement before the Black lives matter movement. Saying all lives matter exists with the sole function of being a counter argument or distraction to civil rights issues.

Gayness does not to be cured. It is not a disease. It is not a choice. There is absolutely nothing wrong with it. Now lets respect one another and help stop this abuse.	Hope_speech

No you‚Äôre missing the point. When a black life is taking there is no consequence to the police. When a white man takes a white man‚Äôs life the life matters when a black man takes a black male life the wife matters when an agent man takes an Asian man life the life matters. But when you have cops killing black people regularly on camera and getting away with it. You tend to believe black lives don‚Äôt matter. Because if it was white people in those situations it would never have had happened. So then you have to ask yourself do black lives matter to the American government and the judicial system. The answer is no! Do all lives matter yes of course that‚Äôs been established. Now let‚Äôs talk about the lies that are being taken by the people who are supposed to protect us. Stop avoiding the point. I can‚Äôt even believe they talking about in all lives matter debate versus a black lives matter debate. The day you see all lies being treated the way black people has been treated then we will have it all lives matter debate.	Non_hope_speech

@DragyTD People are reaching. Not once did anyone say 'ONLY black people lives matter' but when you're talking about stuff like 'Save the Turtles' people don't automatically assume that those that say it are saying that we should save ONLY turtles. People just don't want black people to have things to themselves. All the time we are expected to share our stuff. So people can stop lying about 'it implies that only black lives matter'. When SE Asians were being discriminated against in the UK and America not ONCE did someone say ALM and not once did people mention the struggles that people of other races go through UNTIL people said BLM.

It's not about black lives.

It also says a thousand other things are sinful (things we are all guilty off in our lifetime) the Bible clearly says all sin is forgivable. The Bible says the greatest commandment is love.

Honestly put some donation boxes on the statue and donate the funds to a slavery museum like the one in Liverpool. History is done.

MrCosmin94 and your statement ‚Äúopening‚Äù people‚Äôs minds is completely invalid when you yourself have no prior knowledge to a actual topic. And making a point as bland as ‚Äúwho created god ‚Äú is like asking which universe created the universe. Because from a naturalistic view there has to be a natural non divine explanation. And based on the Laws of thermodynamics energy can‚Äôt just appear and disappear but be constant. So when you take nothing and create an infinite expanding universe with finite energy that is always constant and never created or taken away you come to question how that energy got there in the first place? It is the reasonable human reaction. So to tell people who have found peace in an answer for themselves makes you someone that can‚Äôt stand others happiness or comfortability. You would think being a human being you would have more compassion towards others and their own choices. Like I don‚Äôt judge you for yours	Non_hope_speech

I find the statement BLACK lives matter Offensive and RACIST towards me as It should have said ALL lives matter. The FACT you have to bring up MLK from over 50 yrs ago shows you still live in the past. I have always taken people at face value regardless of their skin colour but to try and rewrite history by pulling monuments down and wanting to get rid of things like the confederate flag and ban tv shows and movies is going to the extreme in my opinion.

Mmmm. I would disagree. Religion is belief if you believe something hard enough it stops becoming a choice. People in soviet Russia were brainwashed to make them love Stalin. They couldn‚Äôt make an active choice to deny it because that‚Äôs the way they perceived the world around them. It‚Äôs like seeing a green apple and trying to convince yourself it‚Äôs not green. It‚Äôs almost impossible because that‚Äôs how you see it. If a religious person sees homosexuality as wrong and believe it enough it becomes less of a choice and more of  a perception of the environment around them.	Non_hope_speech	
So at this time. And for a long time. Black and brown are abused and murdered at a high rate. So it‚Äôs nothing wrong with accentuated and pointing out the obvious.  What about statistics ?	Non_hope_speech

All lives matter and frankly from what I've seen is that gun laws in America are yet again the true problem whether out of prejudice towards the colour of skin I think it's ludicrous the chances between the rich and poor are divided and that is where the true issue is it is difficult to get rid on one bigoted billionaire that so happens to be the president of the United States but laws around the world have no difficulties ridding poor people out of the society so therefore I'm afraid that the majority is playing a dangerous game of racial anger that can result in a civil war that would not be beneficial for whatever colour of skin you've put your bets on so when I say all lives matter I mean to say	Hope_speech

That shit happens everyday dumbass. You just don't hear about it. OBVIOUSLY	Non_hope_speech	
@Molly Rebekah Girl I'm Christian too and you are waaaaaaaaaaaaay outta line. What I'm taught from the bible and what I see it saying is that we should love all. Do you believe that God loves each and every one of us cause that's what we are taught as Christians that he loves everyone of us. So the fact you think God doesn't like LGBTQ people is misinformed because God loves all of us not just some of us ALL of us.nnIt's people like you that give us Christians a bad name because you want to make your own version of life where God only likes what you think and that's what you tell people. When in fact God loves all of us and wants us to love eachother like we want to be loved.  So before you come here claiming to be Christian go and rethink everything you think and read up on what God teaches us. nnnLike girl bye.	Hope_speech

If you think that black lives matter means only black lives matter you've shown your own ignorance this movement of black lives matter is a cry out saying black lives matter also... It is sick that a cop would shoot an unarmed or non lethally armed black man. Whites get killed by the cops but 9 times out of ten they were in the wrong the problem is the gross misconduct of excessive jail time and innocent black lives in jail. That's what these people started the black lives matter movement and it's media who have the responsibility to convey the grievances of the people yet you leave us wanting... There are bad protesters and there are bad cops but untill police brotherhood is disbarred and cops work like Walmart employees where they see someone in the wrong they stop it instead of covering it up we're gonna sit here and stew in the wreckage of our ignorance.

You don't get it do you. Black Lives Matter does not mean white lives don't. It just means Black lives are being treated unfairly by the police and this needs to stop. If there's a burning house you would try to save it and not say no but All Houses Matter... Your house isn't burning... Black people needs the BLM movement to get equality.

All lives matter. Cops are abusive to all of us and there is a problem. Focusing on only black lives and shutting down the white person's voice is the Social Justice warrior way. It is totally destructive. The poor are being kept poor black or white. It is the poor that has more interaction with the police and are more susceptible abuse by the police.

I want you to know that I watched this video when I was ten years old right when it came out. I have never been more grateful for a video. Since I watched this I have changed my entire trajectory. All of my goals and everything I spend my time on is to become an engineer. I am now a Junior in high school and I have been on a robotics team for 5 years. I spend my time teaching other people about engineering and doing outreach events to inspire young kids to go into STEM. I am in a Pre-Engineering program. I created a STEAM event to teach kids how art and STEM are related. I have done all of this because of this single video. All the time and energy that I have put in I did because of this video. Thank you so much you gave me a passion I didn't know I had and it has changed my entire life. I know you won't see this but I feel in debt to you and I needed to thank you.	Hope_speech

You are ignorant. People don't say white lives don't matter when they say black lives matter. White lives have always mattered and valued more than black lives. To ignore the disproportionate targeting of black people is bizarre. Or maybe you think this society is a happy accident where black people are lesser beings and they made their bed. Saying black lives matter does not mean white lives don't. Saying all lives matter invalidate people that recognize that black people are subjected to racism. If you think black people are subjected to violence the same as whites you are seeing things from a bias that enjoys having power over others.	Non_hope_speech

There has never been a question of all lives matter. The fundamental issue is black lives matter the same. This country has never questioned the value of white lives. It has historically undermined the lives of black and brown lives. The movement is questioning systematic racism and trying to bring the country to a balance state by addressing black lives and making our lives matter as well. There is not a black person that doesn't understand all lives matter	Non_hope_speech

I could maybe be sympathetic if they were less vague. All I hear is them ascribing sinister motives to people who seem like they are just being overly friendly nerds.nAnd these testimonials right before the statstics on women engineers in Silicon Valley seem to imply that the reason that there are less women in tech there is because it is a hostile environment for women. But step in your typical engineering classroom in America and then tell me that there are as many women interested in engineering as men.
